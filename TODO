- move topgen.info from 1.1.1.1 to e.g. 0.0.0.1 (or something legal but
  *not* cloudflare's dns server -- might need to use that address in-game!!!

- split out topgen-scrape.sh (or implement sub-commands); these are
  all potentially very long running operations (e.g., scraping may
  take weeks), so unexpected things may happen, and resuming manually
  should be possible without too much overhead:
	- scraping
	- certificate generation
	- vhost IP address resolution

- add debian/ubuntu package spec
	- for now, systemd units on debian/ubuntu go under /lib, which is
	  not (yet) merged with /usr/lib; hold off on addressing this issue
	  in our unit files, since a merge is underway (for details, see
	  https://lwn.net/Articles/670071).

- can we configure topgen-loopback service to shut down when last service
  depending on it goes away ?

- SELinux policy for sbin scripts (right now calling chcon explicitly)

- augment Web and DNS data with (simulated) WHOIS functionality
